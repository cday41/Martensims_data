Summaries_compiled.csv
  Containes summary input and output data for each simulation scenario
  EW and WE indicate east to west and west to east simulations, respectively
  LU and NLU indicate whether land use change was (LU) or was not (NLU) included
  Hist, C45, and C85 indicate the climate scenario - historical, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5
  Gen = generation
  SLDist = straight-line dispersal distance
  Alive = no. of individuals that survived and established a home range by the end of a given year

SEARCH_Arc10.5.zip
  Contains the version of SEARCH used to run simulations, compiled for ArcGIS Desktop version 10.5

Traverse10reps.csv
